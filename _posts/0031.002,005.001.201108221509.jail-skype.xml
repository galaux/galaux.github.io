	<content><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/fr/home">Skype</a> is the most used voip software used accross the world. Unfortunately when you dig a bit about it you may find yourself surprised with its developers' way of understanding the word "privacy". Reports have been made about <a href="http://forum.skype.com/index.php?showtopic=95261">Skype binaries reading sensitive Linux password files</a> and <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/07/08/26/1312256/Skype-Linux-Reads-Password-and-Firefox-Profile">user personal data</a>. As Skype is the perfect example of closed source application one cannot even know if these statements are true. Moreover, it seems Skype makes heavy use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_protocol#Obfuscation_Layer">obfuscation methods</a>. It just so happens an <a href="http://www.archlinux.org">Archer</a> explained this <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Skype#Use_Skype_with_special_user">simple way of jailing Skype into a reserved Linux account</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is very simple: create a <tt>skype</tt> group and a <tt>skype</tt> user with its own home directory. Then just setup your regular user to launch the <tt>skype</tt> binary as this user using <tt>sudo</tt>. If you grant this <tt>skype</tt> user restricted rw rights, this will elegantly jail this impolite Skype software.</p>]]></content>
