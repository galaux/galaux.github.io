## Profile

I am a backend and data engineer with ops skills and some interest in front-end
development. I am able to understand a general computer science problem with
potential scalability issues, design and discuss solutions potentially
involving distributed systems and databases and implement them in a
professional fashion.

This usually means:

- developing proof of concepts
- setting up initial projects, CI/CD, …
- coding features with their different test families
- writing deployment code for a cloud infrastructure
- incrementally adding and fixing the initial result
- reporting and communicating on work done and to be done

My daily work habits include ensuring I write simple clear and efficient tested
code, version and document it, set or improve the team's tooling regarding code
quality, automatic delivery and deployment. I also check the software I work on
include reporting and alerting and I regularly troubleshoot and fix problems
that arise in live environments. Depending on my position in the team I pair
with team-mates, submit/review code or simply try to learn as much as possible
or improve knowledge sharing.

I am interested in Clojure, TypeScript/Node.js, Go, Rust backend/data long-
term projects and work as a contractor. I do not wish to work with Java nor
Scala anymore.
